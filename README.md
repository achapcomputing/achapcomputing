### Hi, I'm Ashlyn

I am a computer science student at NC State. I completed a full 3 rotations of a co-op on a DevOps team at LexisNexis. Currently, I am interning on an IT team at Cisco where I work with Django and containers.

Outside of programming, I spend much of my time running or rowing out of doors or at the gym. I also love listening to, playing, and writing music. My love for these two things can be seen in my work on Pumpify, where I am trying to create personalized workout-specific playlists.
