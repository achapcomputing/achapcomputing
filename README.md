# Hi, I'm Ashlyn

I am a computer science student at NC State. I completed a full 3 rotations of a co-op on the DevOps team at LexisNexis. Currently, I am interning on an IT team at Cisco where I work with Django and containers.

Most of my previous experience centers around infrastructure and automation. In the future, I am looking to learn more about data. This fall I am taking a databases course and a course about data analysis and automated learning.

I also have been building some web apps to learn frontend web development.

- [Pumpify](https://achapcomputing.github.io/pumpify)

Outside of programming, I spend much of my time running or rowing out of doors or at the gym. I also love listening to, playing, and writing music. My love for these two things can be seen in my work on [Pumpify](https://achapcomputing.github.io/pumpify), where I am trying to create personalized workout-specific playlists.

On this account you can find all of my personal work. Anything I created for school exists in private repositories, so that I do not enable cheating. Additionally, any demos or trainings I complete to learn a new topic live in a GitHub organization, [achap-archive][archive]. These are demos I reference rather often but would otherwise clutter my personal GitHub profile.

## Code with me

My most used languages on my personal projects. However, most of my university projects are built with Java or C, and my work history focused on Python.
